# Automated TCC Setup
## Alexander Mervar

### Introduction
This is a Python script using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) that opens urls for the user so there is no need to go through the typical dance when starting the day at TCC.

### Adjusting The Script for You
When adjusting this script for your own personal use, just open the [automate.py](automate.py) file. There you can adjust the variables 'timeForUser' and the 'urls' array in order to fit your own needs.

### Assisting with Development
Although this is a pretty simple project, it is open-source and your are more than welcome to utilize this code in any way in order to make addendums or changes. Additionally, if you have some work that would be helpful to the original repository, please submit a request.

I hope you enjoy the script!

Best Wishes.
Alexander
